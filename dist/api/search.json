Beyond traditional commercial entities, these communities prioritize shared consensus and collective goals over pure economic gain. They are fans guilds, clubs, and collaborative hubs where people \"figure it out together.\"\n\nTo empower this vision, we develop **Digital Public Goods**—open-source, self-sovereign tools designed for individuals and communities to host, build, and evolve independently. This forms the core of the **Mycelium Protocol**, a mission-driven ecosystem focused on three pillars: Digital Public Goods, Sustainable Collaborative Networks, and Prediction-based Incubation.\n\n**CN:** 我们预见未来将出现一种超越传统商业实体的组织形态：**松散社区与极致个体**。这些社区不以经济利益为唯一驱动，而是以共识和协作为核心，涵盖了爱好者社区、俱乐部及各类目标驱动的协作组织。\n\n为了赋能这一未来场景，我们构建了一系列**数字公共物品（Digital Public Goods）**。这些工具完全开源，支持个体与社区自主部署与运行。这构成了 **Mycelium Protocol** 的核心使命：通过数字公共物品、可持续协作网络与预测市场孵化，释放个体的潜能。\n\n---\n\n## Vision / 愿景\n\n**EN:** Empowering **Extreme Individuals** to thrive within diverse **Loose Communities** connected by the **Mycelium Protocol**—reclaiming their imagination, creativity, and emotions to transcend alienation and truly \"become themselves.\"\n\n**CN:** 极致个体生活在由 **Mycelium（菌丝协议）** 连接的多个松散社区中，释放想象力、创造力与情感，摆脱异化，回归自我。\n\n---\n\n## Mission / 使命\n\n**EN:** To realize our vision by consistently building **Digital Public Goods**, fostering a **Sustainable Mycelial Network** for collaboration, and exploring innovation through **Prediction Markets**.\n\n**CN:** 通过持续构建数字公共物品，形成可持续协作的真菌网络，以预测市场的方式探索创新，从而达成愿景。\n\n---\n\n## Architecture / 架构\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhfnetboy/MarkDownImg/main/img/202602281140824.png)\n\n## References / 参考资料\n\n- **Presentation:** [Mycelium Protocol Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XLEl4sd5Qe9kKMrUwSby7Dk-9G-fw3pqJWhXmDosv4k/edit?usp=sharing)","tags":["vision","mission","manifesto"],"path":"doc-4-Mycelium-Manifesto.md"}},{"type":"document","score":null,"document":{"id":"doc-3","title":"Related links","type":"other","createdDate":"2026-02-28 05:28","rawContent":"# Related links\n## Speak slides collection\n- [Be Yourself YoungMan Speak Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LYWK1BETRRygChza3NCF7nVxRsjR_ymyagyrY9jL3gU/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Open Source Empower Individuals](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T2pAuX2ZRakLq0JI6HT5Kn_NW31DVGGP9p-SrlOzqLs/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Mycelium quick intro](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XLEl4sd5Qe9kKMrUwSby7Dk-9G-fw3pqJWhXmDosv4k/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Cos72+Sin90](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dc6Rygjw0qQUAohB7pUq-FNsiXox6P0cUhm28qELEBs/edit?usp=sharing)\n- \n## Tech related\n[Gas on Ethereum](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nzTe40Img2E8iinYk-Fk3IXLqC_TXidMys5Mec0R2og/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## Tech research related\n[Research docs list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ec6OyzmefxSMJUdjL-BF1TQtZ-ylZ-vGl4MF9PJ4jc/edit?usp=sharing)","path":"doc-3-Related-links.md"}},{"type":"document","score":null,"document":{"id":"doc-5","title":"Roadmap 2026-2027","type":"roadmap","createdDate":"2026-02-28 06:15","updatedDate":"2026-02-28 11:40","rawContent":"# 🗺️ BroodBrain Roadmap 2026-2027+\n\n## 🌈 愿景驱动：人性之光\n> **思维链条**：个体 -> 自由与人性 -> 菌丝协议协作 -> 经济模型探索 -> 社区与多样性\n\n我们相信，未来的组织形态是**松散社区与极致个体**。\n- **社区最需要什么？** Onboarding + 正反馈激励 + Check = **COS72**。\n- **个体需要什么？** 时间、空间、经济可持续，释放想象力、创造力和情感。\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 Phase 1: Genesis Launch (2026.03.30)\n**重点：冷启动与基础建设**\n- [ ] **Cos72 Chrome Extension**: 用户入口，集成支付与账户。\n- [ ] **SuperPaymaster**: 去中心化 Gas 支付协议。\n- [ ] **AirAccount**: 解决加密账户门槛。\n- [ ] **MushroomDAO**: 启动GToken与首次投票。\n\n## 🍄 Phase 2: Community Expansion (2026 H2)\n**重点：协作网络与软硬件方案**\n- [ ] **Cos72 社区 OS**: MyTask, MyShop, MyVote 模块上线。\n- [ ] **xPNTs/MySBT**: 完善积分与身份协议。\n- [ ] **AirAccount 硬件**: 推出海外/国内边缘计算 KMS 方案。\n- [ ] **OpenNest**: 孵化 Zu.Coffee, HHH, Arcadia。\n\n## 🌳 Phase 3: Ecosystem Maturity (2027+)\n**重点：多样性与可持续发展**\n- [ ] **Spores/Park Protocol**: 病毒传播与可持续公共物品协议。\n- [ ] **OpenCity**: ChiangMai Connect 试点。\n- [ ] **DApp Ecosystem**: TradeStar, CoinJar 等全方位应用。","path":"doc-5 - Roadmap-2026-2027.md"}},{"type":"decision","score":null,"decision":{"id":"decision-1","title":"Start MushroomDAO Cold Launch / 启动 MushroomDAO 冷启动","date":"2026-02-28 12:01","status":"accepted","context":"","decision":"","consequences":"","rawContent":"## Context / 背景\n**EN:** We believe the future will be defined by a new organizational paradigm: the emergence of Loose Communities and Extreme Individuals.
